## 👋 Hey, I’m Pontus Abrahamsson

I build **calm user experiences** and **robust systems** — especially in domains where data models are messy and correctness actually matters, like real estate, planning, and infrastructure.

Lately I’ve been focused on how **natural language can interact with real data safely**, without shortcuts, magic strings, or hidden assumptions.

---

## 🧠 What I’m interested in

- Intent-based systems (NL → validated actions)
- Compiler-style architectures for AI tooling
- Schema-driven design as a single source of truth
- Making complex domains feel understandable to humans

I care deeply about **clarity, constraints, and trust** — both in UI and backend systems.

## 🛠️ Tech I work with

### Frontend
- React · Vite · TypeScript  
- Animation, UX polish, performance tuning

### Backend
- Node.js · Fastify · GraphQL  
- Prisma · PostgreSQL  
- Schema & API design

### AI / Systems (exploring)
- Local LLMs (Ollama)  
- Intent compilation & validation  
- Rust for tooling and infrastructure

## 🕳️ Experiments

I sometimes publish small, privacy-first system experiments outside of my normal repos.

One of them lives here:

**https://deadletter.cc**

It explores how hardware devices, trust anchors and offline verification can be used to exchange messages without centralized identity or user accounts.

No tracking, no analytics — just systems design.

## 🧪 Recent experiment (archived)

**llmd** — a compiler-style intent engine that turns natural language into **safe, schema-validated queries**.

It explored what happens when you treat language like source code:

- parse intent into a strict AST  
- apply ownership & scope rules derived from the data model  
- compile into GraphQL only if the intent is valid  
- separate *reasoning* from *execution* completely

The project is currently paused, but it heavily influenced how I think about building **predictable, auditable AI systems**.
