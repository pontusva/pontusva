# 👋 Hey, I’m Pontus Abrahamsson

I’m a developer who enjoys building **calm user experiences** and **robust systems** — especially in domains where data models are complex and correctness actually matters (like real estate, planning, and infrastructure).

Lately I’ve been spending a lot of time thinking about **how natural language can safely interact with real data**, without shortcuts or magic strings.

---

## 🧠 What I’m interested in

- Intent-based systems (NL → validated actions)
- Compiler-style architectures for AI tools
- Schema-driven design (single source of truth)
- Making complex domains feel understandable to humans

I care a lot about **clarity, constraints, and trust** — both in UI and backend systems.

## 🛠️ Tech I work with

**Frontend**
- React · Vite · TypeScript
- Animation, UX polish, performance

**Backend**
- Node.js · Fastify · GraphQL
- Prisma · PostgreSQL
- Schema & API design

**AI / Systems (exploring)**
- Local LLMs (Ollama)
- Intent compilation & validation
- Rust for tooling and infrastructure

---

## 🚧 Current side project

**llmd** — a compiler-style intent engine that turns natural language into **safe, schema-validated queries**.

Instead of letting an LLM “guess SQL”, llmd:
- parses intent into a structured AST
- applies ownership & scope rules derived from the data model
- compiles into GraphQL only if the intent is valid
- cleanly separates *reasoning* from *execution*

It’s an experiment in making AI systems **predictable, auditable, and boring (in a good way)**.
