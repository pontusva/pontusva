# 👋 Hey, I'm Pontus Abrahamsson

I'm a developer who enjoys building smooth user experiences and smart tools — especially for real estate and complex systems. I like keeping things fast, clean, and a little bit clever.

## 🛠️ Tech I work with
- React · Vite · TypeScript  
- Node.js · Fastify · GraphQL  
- Ollama & local LLMs (just for fun... mostly)
