# 👋 Hey, I’m Pontus Abrahamsson

I’m a developer who enjoys building **calm user experiences** and **robust systems** — especially in domains where data models are complex and correctness actually matters (like real estate, planning, and infrastructure).

Lately I’ve been spending a lot of time thinking about **how natural language can safely interact with real data**, without shortcuts or magic strings.

---

## 🧠 What I’m interested in

- Intent-based systems (NL → validated actions)
- Compiler-style architectures for AI tools
- Schema-driven design (single source of truth)
- Making complex domains feel understandable to humans

I care a lot about **clarity, constraints, and trust** — both in UI and backend systems.

## 🛠️ Tech I work with

**Frontend**
- React · Vite · TypeScript
- Animation, UX polish, performance

**Backend**
- Node.js · Fastify · GraphQL
- Prisma · PostgreSQL
- Schema & API design

**AI / Systems (exploring)**
- Local LLMs (Ollama)
- Intent compilation & validation
- Rust for tooling and infrastructure

## 🕳️ Experiments

I sometimes publish small, privacy-first system experiments outside of my normal repos.

One of them lives here:

**https://deadletter.cc**

It explores how hardware devices, trust anchors and offline verification can be used to exchange messages without centralized identity or user accounts.

No tracking, no analytics — just systems design.

## 🧪 Recent experiment (archived)

**llmd** — a compiler-style intent engine that turns natural language into **safe, schema-validated queries**.

It explored what happens when you treat language like source code:

- parse intent into a strict AST  
- apply ownership & scope rules derived from the data model  
- compile into GraphQL only if the intent is valid  
- separate *reasoning* from *execution* completely

The project is currently paused, but it heavily influenced how I think about building **predictable, auditable AI systems**.
